How to Configure MAA

When the Application is opened for the first time, user will be presented with a Wizard-Like configuration interface

1. Introduction
This gives an overview of what the application do

2. Basic Parameters
This allows user to set basic parameters of the system. They are,
Frequency - What is the time frame between execution of the two steps of the algorithm
Number of Jobs - A job is a single data mining task. User can create several Jobs (e.g. For different stores, For different divisions, etc.)
Job IDs - Specify IDs for each Job
This will be persisted in the Config/basic_config.xml

3. Data Parameters
This allows user to set parameters related to data fed to the system
Home Dir - The home directory where the data (in correct format required by the system) is persisted
This will be persisted in the Config/data_config.xml

4. Algorithm Parameters
This allows user to set parameters related to algorithm
Inputs will be persisted in the Config/algo_config.xml

After the configuration process is finished, user will be presented with a interface where the system show results.

There, user will be shown a graph depicting the learning outcome.
